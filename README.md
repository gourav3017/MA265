# MA265 Section 041 - Fall 2016



## Installation of Required Software for Viewing the Notebookes

Find and download the right version of 
[Anaconda for Python 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics.
This package contains most of the software we are going to need.

### OS Specific Instructions

#### Microsoft Windows

+ We need C, C++, Fortran compilers, as well as the Python sources.
Start a command line (look for ``cmd``) and type:
```
conda install mingw libpython
```
+ Finally, you need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). As you install it,
make sure you select that you want to use it from the Windows command prompt.

#### Apple OS X

+ Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
+ Agree to the license of Xcode by opening a terminal and typing:
```
sudo xcrun cc
```
+ Install your favorite version of the GNU compiler suite.
You can do this with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (after you install it of course),
by typing in the terminal:
```
brew install gcc
```
Alternatively, you may use the [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).

#### Linux

Nothing special is required.

### Installation of Required Python Packages

Independently of the operating system, use the command line to install the following Python packages:
+ [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/), for beatiful graphics:
```
conda install seaborn
```


## Running the notebooks

+ Open the command line.
+ `cd` to your favorite folder.
+ Then, type:
```
git clone https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/MA265.git
```
+ This will download the contents of this repository in a folder called `MA265`.
+ Enter the ``MA265`` folder:
```
cd MA265
```
+ Start the jupyter notebook by typing the command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
+ Use the browser to navigate the course, experiment with code etc.
+ If the course contented is updated, type the following command (while being inside `MA265`) to get the latest version:
```
git pull origin master
```
Keep in mind, that if you have made local changes to the repository, you may have to commit them before moving on.
